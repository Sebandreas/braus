braus
=====

Braus (pronounced Browse) is a tabbed webbrowser written in VB.NET which won't be as good as some of the major browsers, but will show what is possible in VB.net. Based off of code from Gep13's tabbed browser, Thomas Maxwell's IE7Clone browser, and some other sample codes from other places around the internet.

I am hoping to implement the following functionality into this web browser, including, and not limited to the following:
 - Live, changing of rendering engines (currently between Trident and Webkit). Like Maxthon, I guess.
 - The ability to manage favourites (Gep13, you're a genius)
 - The ability to create addons for the browser
 - Customisable search engines (like in IE7+, FF, et cetera)
 - Functionality similar to Foxyproxy, but built-in to the browser.
 - Port functionality from http://goo.gl/yzs7g to Visual Basic and implement somehow :3
 - Other things I'll come up with and list in the readme.
 - Implementation of the Visual Basic spellcheck script (i00 spellcheck, http://goo.gl/aHqXQ) in the context of webbrowser.
 - <i>Possibly</i> replace vanilla webbrowser control with a modified version of this: http://goo.gl/QLFR3

This piece of software is going to be released under the MIT license for now. This is so I can use the code from Gep13's browser.
